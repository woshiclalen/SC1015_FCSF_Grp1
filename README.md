# Train Occupancy Prediction Application

## Overview / Project
The Train Occupancy Prediction Application is a project aimed at providing commuters with real-time information on train occupancy levels to help them make informed decisions about their travel plans. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) models, the application predicts the number of people in each train at a given time, allowing commuters to choose less crowded trains and more comfort levels.

## Motivation / Problem Definition
Commuting via train is a common aspect of urban life, but it often comes with uncertainties regarding train occupancy. The lack of real-time information on train occupancy poses challenges for commuters in planning their journeys, leading to overcrowded or uncomfortable travel experiences. The Train Occupancy Prediction Application aims to address this problem by providing commuters with accurate predictions of train occupancy, thereby improving the overall commuting experience.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset containing historical data on train occupancy levels at various stations and times. The dataset includes information on the number of people in each train and the corresponding timestamps. This data serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the predictive models used in the application.

## Core Analysis
The project employs machine learning techniques, specifically SARIMA and ARIMA models, to predict train occupancy levels. These models analyze historical data on train occupancy and use it to make predictions about future occupancy levels. By incorporating both non-seasonal and seasonal components, the models are able to capture complex patterns and variations in train occupancy over time.

## Application Features
